Intro
-----

This repository provides MATLAB codes for patch learning and patch plots as shown in our previous publications:


[1] "[Joint Patch and Multi-label Learning for Facial Action Detection](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Zhao_Joint_Patch_and_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)", CVPR 2016.

[2] "[Joint Patch and Multi-label Learning for Facial Action Unit and Holistic Expression Recognition](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7471506/)", TIP 2016.



This code aims for active patch learning (APL), and the learned patches display in face images. This code requires "[SPArse Modeling Software](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/)".


File structure

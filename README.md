Intro
-----

This repository provides the matlab codes for patch learning and patches plotting in the TIP2016 paper, "[Joint Patch and Multi-label Learning for Facial Action Unit and Holistic Expression Recognition](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7471506/)" This code aims for active patch learning (APL), and the learned patches display in face images. This implementation is based on "[SPArse Modeling Software](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/)".
